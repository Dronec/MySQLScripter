# MySQLScripter

This is a simple console tool for scripting out objects from MySQL (one file per object).

I've made it to simplify source-controlling MySQL objects.

## Usage

```bash
MySQLScripter.exe path=[output path] type=[sp or table or view] database=[database name] server=[server name] port=[server port] user=[username] pw=[password]
```
